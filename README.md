# Credit Card UI
An Interactive React Web Application to Add and View Credit cards.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### 1. Clone the card-ui repo and install dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nitinmaram/card-ui.git
```

Install npm dependencies:

npm install
```

### 2. Clone the card-microservice repo which is the pre requisite for card-ui to run

This is the required backend micro service which serves the APIs for card-ui

```sh
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.\
